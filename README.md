# Brazilian Car Rental Challenge 🚗💨
Welcome to the Brazilian Car Rental Challenge! This project is all about creating a dynamic and robust program that can handle the intricacies of car rental pricing in Brazil.

## The Challenge 🏁
In Brazil, car rentals are charged at an hourly rate for rentals up to 12 hours. However, if you’re planning a longer trip and the rental exceeds 12 hours, the rental switches to a daily rate. But that’s not all! In addition to the rental cost, a tax is added to the price according to the country’s rules. For amounts up to R$100.00, the tax is 20%, and for amounts above R$100.00, the tax drops to 15%.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a program that reads the rental data (car model, rental date, and vehicle return date), as well as the hourly and daily rental values. The program must then generate a payment invoice containing the rental amount, tax amount, and total payment amount, and display this data on the screen.

## Examples 📖
Here are a couple of examples to illustrate how the program should work:

### Example 1:
Car model: Civic
Pickup (dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm): 25/06/2018 10:30h
Return (dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm): 25/06/2018 14:40h
Price per hour: R$ 10.00
Price per day: R$ 130.00

Invoice:
Basic payment: R$ 50.00
Tax: R$ 10.00
Total Payment: R$ 60.00

### Example 2:
Car model: Tesla
Pickup (dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm): 25/06/2018 10:30h
Return (dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm): 27/06/2018 11:40h
Price per hour: R$ 10.00
Price per day: R$ 130.00

Invoice:
Basic payment: R$ 390.00
Tax: R$ 58.00
Total Payment: R$ 448.50
